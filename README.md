1. Added .gitignore to skip committing package-lock.json

Tackling the first scenario, This was my first time receiving a Readable Stream from a fetch call (and also seeing in general). Once I saw that the response wasn't JSON I spent my time researching what a Readable Stream is how to read and parse it. I managed to successfully convert that into JSON and then get it on screen, but not without 151 hits to either the api or the service worker. (Unclear, also my first time working with service workers).

Looking at the second scenario, I've been listening to podcasts talking about setting up a web app to work without JavaScript and without Network connectivity, but I haven't attemtped that kind of functionality yet.

The majority of my experience revolves around building React frameworks and consuming REST apis that return JSON data. Updating the UI was not part of this project, but I could certainly implement a table, or flexbox structured display instaead of just listing the names. My past experience focuses on creating comprehensive and user friendly UIs.

I'd love to learn the ins and outs of readable streams and identify their use cases and benefits.
